# Picture-in-Picture

Watch your favorite videos in Picture-in-Picture mode using this web page. Picture-in-Picture basically gives you a small window that stays on top of all other windows so that you can do other stuff while watching a video in a small window.

This is helpful in situations such as when you want to code along while watching a coding tutorial. You don't need to switch between windows again and again or put them side by side. Simply use Picture-in-Picture mode to run your code editor in fullscreen and the video in a small window.


This web page uses the Picture-in-Picture API and Screen Capture API to provide Picture-in-Picture mode. To learn more about these APIs check out the links below :
